            <p style="font-weight: 200;">OnePwaa is an international nonprofit organisation ensuring that the World Scholar's Cup community has access to resources and services that benefit individuals within the community. We do this by lowering scholarsâ€™ barriers of entry to the concept and practice of collaborative learning or education, including but not limited to scholarship programs, debate camps, and online guides. <br> Currently, I am working as the Director of Web Design in OnePwaa. I oversee changes to the website and upload contents such as Study Guides, Essays, etc. Besides working on the website, I've hosted an Online WSCamp with over 150 participants, where scholars can hone their debate and writing skills.  </p>

            <p style="font-weight: 200;">Pwaasitivity is an Instagram initiative to spread positivity among the World Scholar's Cup community. We receive submissions about scholars' positive experiences in the World Scholar's Cup through Direct Messages and/or Tellonym. These submissions are filtered out to ensure that the content is appropriate and family-friendly. Content that passes our filtering process will then be posted on our <a href="https://instagram.com/pwaasitivity">Instagram page.</a> We also post Instagram story templates and filters related to the World Scholar's Cup.<br> I co-founded this organization with a few friends in the summer of 2019 in hopes that scholars who participated in the World Scholar's Cup can have a platform to express their love to the community. We started this initiative as a way to give back to the WSC community, which has always been so supportive and accepting of us.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: 200;">Bye Bye Plastic Bags is an NGO driven by youth to say NO to plastic bags. <br> I write proposals for any BBPB-related events and find ways to record and manage data in an efficient way. I've aided the team with communication that ensures everyone knows what's going on.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: 200;">ProjectBuzzID (PBID) is a social youth organization and platform put together and run by Indonesian high-school and university students established in April 2019. It currently bases most of its operations on Instagram as a way to start conversations on social issues. Some social issues that the platform has discussed in the past are bullying, mental health and climate change. PBID aims to spark change in and inspire our society by encouraging people, especially the youth, to stay informed, educated and empowered. <br> Because I've always been passionate about raising awareness for social issues, I decided to join the ProjectBuzz Team. With my team, I think up of events and write proposals.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-bottom: -5px;">Participant (2018-2019); Volunteer (2020)</h4>
            <p style="font-weight: 200;">The World Scholar's Cup is an international team academic program with students participating from over 65 countries. The program was founded by DemiDec, in particular by Daniel Berdichevsky, in 2006. Scholars participate in events namely Team Debate, Collaborative Writing, Scholar's Challenge and Scholar's Bowl. <br> As a participant, I competed in 4 rounds and have qualified to the Tournament of Champions. Throughout my journey in the program, I learned more about debate, writing, and research than I ever have. As a volunteer, I helped prepare and organize a regional round (such as purchasing trophies and printing banners!). I have immense love for the program and am looking forward to involving myself in the program. </p>
