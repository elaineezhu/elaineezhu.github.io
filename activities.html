            <p class = "activitydescription" style="font-weight: 200;">OnePwaa is an international nonprofit organisation ensuring that the World Scholar's Cup community has access to resources and services that benefit individuals within the community. We do this by lowering scholarsâ€™ barriers of entry to the concept and practice of collaborative learning or education, including but not limited to scholarship programs, debate camps, and online guides. <br> Currently, I am working as the CEO in OnePwaa. I lead a team of over 30 people and I occassionally oversee changes to the <b><u><a href="https://www.onepwaa.org/">website</a></u></b> and upload contents such as Study Guides, Essays, etc. Besides working on the website, I've hosted an Online World Scholar's Camp during the COVID-19 period. The event had over 150 participants, where scholars can hone their debate and writing skills. The event included an MCQ related to 2020's WSC topics and a debate and essay-writing simulation. I was in charge of the logistical aspects, such as matching scholars into teams, setting up debate rooms, sending out emails, troubleshooting technical difficulties, and more. </p>

            <p class = "activitydescription" style="font-weight: 200;">Pwaasitivity is an Instagram initiative to spread positivity among the World Scholar's Cup community. We receive submissions about scholars' positive experiences in the World Scholar's Cup through Direct Messages and/or Tellonym. These submissions are filtered out to ensure that the content is appropriate and family-friendly. Content that passes our filtering process will then be posted on our <b><u><a href="https://instagram.com/pwaasitivity">Instagram page.</a></u></b> We also post Instagram story templates and filters related to the World Scholar's Cup.<br> I co-founded this organization with a few friends in the summer of 2019 in hopes that scholars who participated in the World Scholar's Cup can have a platform to express their love to the community. We started this initiative as a way to give back to the WSC community, which has always been so supportive and accepting of us.</p>

It currently bases most of its operations on Instagram as a way to start conversations on social issues. Some social issues that the platform has discussed in the past are bullying, mental health and climate change. PBID aims to spark change in and inspire our society by encouraging people, especially the youth, to stay informed, educated and empowered. <br> Because I've always been passionate about raising awareness for social issues, I decided to join the ProjectBuzz Team. With my team, I think up of events and write proposals.</p>

During our seminars, we invite guest speakers with a STEM-centered career to talk about their experiences, and we hold instructional classes relating to STEM. (e.g. robotics and programming classes). I've always been passionate about STEM, and have always wanted to involve myself in the field.</p>

            <p class = "activitydescription" style="font-weight: 200;">Couch Camp 2.0: Worlds Boogaloo is an initiative led by scholars of the World Scholar's Cup in response to the financial issues that WSC has faced. The goal was to raise funds for the World Scholar's Cup through the event. An unofficial round for many countries and regions across the world, held in mid October, was organized. Participants can sign up for this rounds and pay their registration fees directly to the WSC GoFundMe. All donations from scholars to sign up for the rounds will go directly towards ensuring actual WSC regional rounds in 2021. Each round emulates WSC's general round format: Team Debate, Collaborative Writing, Opening & Closing Ceremonies, The Scholar's Challenge, and The Scholar's Bowl. Couch Camp was designed with the aim of allowing scholars to improve their skills and become more entwined with the World Scholar's Cup community. <br> As part of the core team, I was in charge of creating a schedule to accommodate multiple timezones, promotional material, social media outreach, emails, and answering all questions regarding the event. I was also in charge of handling spreadsheets, such as those with sign up details, debate scores, writing scores, and more. Moreover, I formatted materials to be given out to scholars, such as Collaborative Writing motions and schedules.</p>

Scholars participate in events namely Team Debate, Collaborative Writing, Scholar's Challenge and Scholar's Bowl. <br> As a participant, I competed in 4 rounds and have qualified to the Tournament of Champions. Throughout my journey in the program, I learned more about debate, writing, and research than I ever have. As a volunteer, I helped prepare and organize a regional round (such as purchasing trophies and printing banners!). I have immense love for the program and am looking forward to involving myself in the program. </p>

            <h4 class = "activityperiod" style="margin-bottom: -5px;">Contestant (2019)</h4>
            <p class = "activitydescription" style="font-weight: 200;"> The Amazing Spaghetti Machine Contest is open to all students aged 14-17, outside Australia and New Zealand. Students work in teams of 3-4 people and put their knowledge and skills in maths, science, design and engineering to the test in the creation of a â€˜spaghetti machineâ€™ â€” the Italian term for an overly complex machine or device that is used to perform a relatively simple task (also known as a Rube Goldberg's Machine). <br> I competed with 3 of my friends to create a Rube Goldberg Machine that could raise a flag (you can find our video <b><u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD3VUTGuclA">here!</a></u></b>). Although we didn't win, I learned a lot about teamwork and resilience. The contest definitely forced me to think outside the box, and further piqued my interest in engineering. </p>
